# LSCamoflash documentation

Start with [v2.00.0000](https://github.com/dev-zetta/LSCamoflash/releases/tag/v2.00.0000) and `SHA256SUMS`. **Anyka** cameras use `LSCamoflash-2.00.0000-uclibc.tar.gz`; the tested **Fullhan SZ B22705 / 7.6.23** uses the separate `LSCamoflash-2.00.0000-fullhan.tar.gz`. Its public folder needs private credentials and manual startup. The GitHub source ZIP is for development and is not ready to copy to a camera.

## Set up your camera

1. Check the [compatibility and integration notes](integration.md) and your exact firmware revision.
2. Follow the [firmware backup guide](firmware-backup.md) before runtime installation where supported.
3. For Anyka, use the [installation guide](installation.md) and [configuration guide](configuration.md).
4. For Fullhan, follow its [download and private setup](camera-sz-b22705.md#prepare-the-private-payload); do not use the Anyka installers.

The [LSC Smart PTZ 3007325.5 / SI L25502 guide](camera-3007325.5.md) covers firmware 6.2863.125.1348. Backup, Wi-Fi, web UI access, local H.265/H.264 video and PCMA microphone audio have been verified on that camera. ONVIF works through manual connection to its H.264 substream. Local mode replaces Tuya app operation; automatic discovery and toolkit PTZ are unavailable for this profile, and long-term stability remains unverified.
